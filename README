# The Traveler's Assistant

## Description
This app is a combination of a currency converter and translator that you can also use to take notes which will be stored locally.
This was intended for people who might be traveling abroad or making purchases where there isn't a shared language, and could potentially
be used even for ordering stuff online through a website using an unfamiliar language.
